            know about. It is a basic skill for sustainable life. Person
            mastered this skill always justifies each of the penny spend &
            Believe in compounding the Surplus Cash.

          <p>
            The Younger generation needs to participate in money related
            conversations from childhood which leads them to grow into adults
            that have good relationships with money and investing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, personal finance is not a mandatory subject in most
            of the high schools or colleges curriculum. Due to this there is a
            huge lack of basic financial education in young students therefore
            young adults are clueless about how to manage their personal finance
            and money. How to apply for credit is one of the toughest decisions
            out of all.

              Delayed Gratification is the act of resisting an impulsive
              decision of taking reward immediately in the hope of achieving a

              combat the “buy now, pay later” mentality. It would also help them
