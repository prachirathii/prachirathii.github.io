            These days while surfing the internet or watching the mainstream
            news show, every other day, there is a word which you are seeing
            frequently. Hope you too are excited to know about that word and
            that is <b>NFTs</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are enthusiastic about blockchain and crypto then I’m pretty
            sure that you might have heard about the NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
            sometime. These days Most powerful components in the blockchain
            domain are NFTs. NFT is a non-fungible token. NFTs have proved to be
            one of the trending hot topics these days.
          </p>
        </span>
        <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5 fw-bold">What are NFTS?</h3>
        <span id="explain-nft">
          <p>
            NFTs refer to Non - Fungible Tokens/ Digital tokens (the same way a
            Bitcoin is a digital token). You can say NFTs are also a type of
            crypto which are created on a special smart contract platform,
            Currently it is used on Ethereum platform.They are unique digital
            objects which seems cool to own or even profitable to trade as well.
            You can understand this as a digital asset as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's understand the meaning of NFTs word by word. Fungible refers
            to anything which is replaceable or interchangeable. Tokens refer to
            the units. So NFTs are irreplaceable. They all are unique. They are
            digital units or items i.e. tokens. The NFT is best described as a
            sort of digital certificate of authenticity of any art and all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assets like bitcoin come under the fungible items, which means that
            all the bitcoins are the same and completely interchangeable. An
            example of a non-fungible token is a piece of art. Currently,
            Non-Fungible Tokens are the Core Component of any Blockchain-based
            Event Ticketing Application or systems.
          </p>

        <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5 fw-bold">
          How are NFTS related to Cryptocurrency?
        </h3>
        <span id="nft-crypto">
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency is the digital currency which is not authorised by
            any central agency. NFTs are the unique cryptocurrency tokens.As the
            Cryptocurrency works through Blockchain, so do the NFTs. Their
            trading can be tracked easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from being non-interchangeable, NFTs are indivisible too. For
            example in the case of bitcoin you can send Bitcoin in satoshi (<b
              >satoshi</b
            >
            is the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but you are not able to send a
            small portion of NFT to anyone.
          </p>
        </span>
        <h5 class="my-4 fw-bold text-muted">Difference B/W NFTs and Bitcoin</h5>
        <span id="nft-vs-crypto">
          <p>
            Bitcoin and NFTs both are cryptocurrency tokens and are managed
            through blockchain. Bitcoin is fungible in nature that means these
            are transferable, replaceable. Each and every bitcoin has the same
            value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas NFTs have unique values distinct from each other, they are
            irreplaceable.
          </p>
          <h5 class="my-4 fw-bold text-muted">
            It seems many of you are getting confused between What is fungible
            vs. non-fungible?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Let’s take an example and understand the fungible and non-fungible
          </p>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrencies come in the category of fungible items, which means
            that all the currency units in crypto (i.e., tokens) are the same
            and equal, for example grains of rice or dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas Non-fungible tokens are contradictory to that, in this every
            cryptocurrency unit, or token, is unique and cannot be replicated.
            This non-fungible property is used by many things these days, even
            certain types of currencies uses non fungible tokens. In the current
            market trends there is a hell lot of demand for NFT, which is mostly
            fueled by digital art and collectibles. People figured out an
            interesting and unique digital object which has a significant
            monetary value as well. That's why the space has recently loomed,
            encompassing thousands of projects involving artworks, gaming, and
            sports.
          </p>
        </span>
        <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5 fw-bold">How do NFTs work?</h3>
        <span id="how-works">
          <p>
            It really depends on the platform. But due to the vast majority of
            NFTs being created and traded on Ethereum platforms, NFTs use the
            Ethereum blockchain. The second largest cryptocurrency market
            capitalization after Bitcoin is Ethereum. It is a decentralized
            software platform used for its own cryptocurrency, Ether. NFTs are
            basically digital images. Its uniqueness is its existence as a
            digital object on the ethereum blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered. No one can take
            your ownership of an NFT or re-create it which is the exact same
            one. These are permissionless, so that anyone can create, buy, and
            sell the NFT without having a proper permission. Finally Good thing
            is that every NFT is unique, so that it can be viewed by anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be copied but originality has its own value. Let's take the
            example of the famous “MONALISA”. $850 million is the approximate
            current value of this original masterpiece by Leonardo Da Vinci.
            There are millions of copied paintings of Monalisa but they do not
            possess this much expensive value.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            If you are creative enough to make your art unique, you could earn
            millions through NFTs. Crypto Kitties has been a trend. The
            <b>average sale price</b> for a crypto kitty was <b>$65.76</b>.
