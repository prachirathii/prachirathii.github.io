          A mini trip got planned with my family. Packing up the essentials felt
          like as if never done before. Apparently the Covid-19 made me forgot
          to what to pack on a mini vacay.
          <br /><br />
          The level of excitement didn’t feel real hard. Of course, excitement
          was there but in a casual way.
          <br /><br />
          All what I had in my head was just to relax and lighten my mind.
        </span>
        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Day 1</h4>
        <span class="content">
          Waking up early on a foggy morning is tough. The blanket didn’t want
          me to leave it and my bed wasn’t ready for a goodbye. Still I managed
          to leave my home for 3 days. We beginned with the trip.
          <br /><br />
          The first destination was Shreenath Ji Temple in Nathdwara. Quite a
          heavy breakfast satisfied me with all the heat in a winter month.
          <br /><br />
          We left the place to go to Udaipur for the most fun-filled activity I
          planned- Snow Park in Celebration Mall situated in Udaipur. My hard
          luck! Snow Park had permanently shut down. Nevertheless, a hot muddy
          cup having delicious coffee just outside the front gate of the mall
          made me feel delighted. After the first sip, a sigh of relief covered
          my face. What a feeling for a coffee person to get such a coffee at a
          low cost.
          <br /><br />
          After so many hours of traveling, we reached a sacred place- Pavapuri.
          This place is like a huge temple with good simple food, comfortable
          space, beautiful scenery and many more. Every corner of that place was
          filled with positivity and tranquillity. Although it had some strict
          guidelines regarding the timings of eating and food without garlic and
          onion (commonly known as Jain Food); the beauty and the simplicity of
          that place was a treat for my eyes and a wonderful feeling mixed with
          happiness, calmness, positivity, relief. The Art gallery situated
          there displayed gallons of talent in the field of art. The thinking
          and hard work behind each art touched my heart deeply.
        </span>
        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Day 2</h4>
        <span class="content">
          Started off the day with a morning walk exploring the sacred property.
          The chilled wind was pampering my body and the silence with the only
          sound of birds chirping pampered my soul.
          <br /><br />
          Not being a morning person at all, it was all worth it to wake up
          early on a chilled foggy morning.
          <br /><br />
          After some photo sessions which are must and post breakfast we bid
          adieu to that beautiful place and promised to visit it once again.
          <br /><br />
          We adjusted ourselves in the car and left for Mt. Abu, the place I was
          really thrilled to go. Unfortunately, it didn’t meet my expectations
          anywhere close to. It was so hot there throughout the day. We climbed
          the stairs up to a good height for a great view of Guru Shikhar.
          <br /><br />
          Finding a good hotel was an obstacle, prices were as high as sky with
          facilities as low as the ground. We ended up staying at a place inside
          the temple which offered us a worthy sunset view from the terrace.
          <br /><br />
          Finally it got cold there and we went to explore the town. The
          lightings made the Nakki Lake look quite decent instead of the green
          colour-water in the lake due to algae.
          <br /><br />
          I did water zorbing and my wrists were screaming out of pain and in
          day time too I did zip line in not so adventurous park.
          <br /><br />
          Out of nowhere I saw the game of virtual reality and it was amazing.
          The 11 D cinema was a failure. Pizzas at the Pizza Crust compensated
          it.
        </span>
        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Day 3</h4>
        <span class="content">
          It was really cold. We left for Ambaji, Gujarat and we sat on a
          ropeway and felt excited.
          <br /><br />
          Once again we went to Udaipur and this time to explore it and for that
          coffee too. We went to Saheliyon ki Baari. It was nice to see such
          greenery and the photo session was amazing too. We took a boat ride at
          Lake Pichola and that experience for me is a once in a lifetime
          memory. The lake water was so fresh. The view was breath-taking. It
          was so calming and refreshing. At once, I felt it so hard, Damn! Life
          is beautiful. Seriously this is a rare feeling for me.
          <br /><br />
          We went to EklingJi which marked the end of this awesome trip on a
          spiritual note.
          <br /><br />
          Right now after writing this, I feel so warm inside. I am so grateful
          that this trip happened.
